# Particle-IoT-Lighting

This is the Particle Web IDE code that runs the Particle Argon automated lights
in my room. 

The "alexfirstremote.ino" file is the simplified file that interacts with 
the particle mobile app, Alexa (through IFTTT), and a relay-connected IR
remote that controls the outlets connected to the lights. 


The "alexfinalcode4.ino" and "finaltaylor4.ino" codes can be used together with
two separate Particle Argons and HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors to automatically 
control the lights based upon the position of a user in the room
